This project uses Composer [https://getcomposer.org] to manage dependencies.
Upon first install and any upgrade please run composer install.

Configuration settings are read from multiple directories. The highest priority
is given to user-specific settings in ~/.smashpig, then machine-specific settings
in /etc/smashpig, then defaults read from this project's 'config' directory.

Within these folder, global settings like database and queue connections are read
from main.yaml. Settings that can be overridden per provider are read from main.yaml
files in subdirectories named for the provider, with common defaults in
provider-defaults.yaml.

To make SmashPig look in an location other than /etc/smashpig for machine-specific
settings, set environment variables SMASHPIG_GLOBAL_CONFDIR or SMASHPIG_PROVIDER_CONFDIR.

Command-line maintenance scripts have some common options:
    --help
    --memory-limit overrides the limit specified in php.ini
    --config-path specifies a top-priority override configuration file path
    --config-node specifies which configuration node to use
